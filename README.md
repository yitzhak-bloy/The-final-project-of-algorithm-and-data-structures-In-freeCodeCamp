The website can be seen [Here](https://yitzhak-bloy.github.io/freeCodeCamp-JavaScript-Algorithms/).

The website was built to implement and showcase the solutions for [freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects).

These solutions were written to receive the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures final certificate.

Originally the solutions were written in Vanilla JavaScript, but on this website they were converted and written in reactjs and in this library the entire site was written.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The site has five different applications:

1. Palindrome Checker,<br>
Checks whether the passed string is [Palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) or not.

2. Roman Numeral Converter,<br>
Converts the given number into a [roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals).

3. Caesars Cipher,<br>
takes a [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

4. telephone Number Validator,<br>
Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.

5. Cash Register,<br>
You need to introduce the product price and the amount received from the customer and the amounts currently in the cash register, and the site will calculate for you the surplus that comes to the customer.

The website was built mainly for a computer screen, but was adapted by css grid and flexbox for mobile, although it is better adapted to the computer.
